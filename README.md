# Rust Q and A server
Vienna Wagner 2024

Course project for Portland State University's Rust Web Development course, spring 2024 quarter. This will be a question and answer web server implemented in rust. It is an adaptation of the server from `Rust Web Development` by Bastian Gruber, adapted to use axum instead of warp. Currently in a non-functioning state, as I had to end prematurely, hopefully will be fixed soon.
